# 🚀 HostingRaja Deployment Guide

## 📁 Files Ready for Upload

Your `dist` folder contains all the files needed for deployment:

```
dist/
├── assets/           # CSS, JS, and image files
├── images/          # Product images placeholder folder
├── index.html       # Main application file
├── .htaccess        # Apache configuration (CRITICAL)
├── robots.txt       # SEO optimization
├── sitemap.xml      # Search engine sitemap
└── vite.svg         # Favicon
```

## 🎯 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Access HostingRaja cPanel
1. Login to your HostingRaja account
2. Go to cPanel File Manager
3. Navigate to `public_html` folder

### Step 2: Upload Files
1. **DELETE** all existing files in `public_html` (except important ones like `.well-known`)
2. **UPLOAD** all contents from the `dist` folder to `public_html`
3. Make sure `.htaccess` file is uploaded (enable "Show Hidden Files" if needed)

### Step 3: File Permissions
Set proper permissions:
- **Folders**: 755 (including `public_html`, `assets`, `images`)
- **Files**: 644 (including `index.html`, `.htaccess`, etc.)

### Step 4: Verify Upload
Check that these files exist in `public_html`:
- ✅ `index.html`
- ✅ `.htaccess`
- ✅ `assets/` folder with CSS and JS files
- ✅ `images/` folder for product photos
- ✅ `robots.txt`
- ✅ `sitemap.xml`

## 🔧 HostingRaja Specific Configuration

### .htaccess File
The `.htaccess` file is **CRITICAL** for proper routing. It contains:
- React Router support
- Compression settings
- Browser caching
- Security headers
- Custom error pages

### Domain Configuration
1. Update `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` with your actual domain
2. Replace `https://yourdomain.com` with your real domain

### SSL Configuration
1. Enable SSL in HostingRaja cPanel
2. Update all links to use `https://`

## 📱 Testing After Deployment

Test these URLs to ensure everything works:
- ✅ `https://yourdomain.com/` (Homepage)
- ✅ `https://yourdomain.com/about` (About page)
- ✅ `https://yourdomain.com/services` (Services page)
- ✅ `https://yourdomain.com/products` (Products page)
- ✅ `https://yourdomain.com/contact` (Contact page)
- ✅ `https://yourdomain.com/booking` (Booking page)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If you get 404 errors on direct URLs:
1. Check if `.htaccess` file exists in `public_html`
2. Verify file permissions (644 for `.htaccess`)
3. Contact HostingRaja support to enable `mod_rewrite`

### If images don't load:
1. Upload your product images to `images/` folder
2. Check image file names match exactly (case-sensitive)

### If site doesn't load at all:
1. Check `index.html` exists in `public_html`
2. Verify folder permissions (755)
3. Check error logs in cPanel

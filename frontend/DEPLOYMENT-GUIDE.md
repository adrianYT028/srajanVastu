Your React application has been successfully built for production and is ready for deployment.

## 📁 Deployment Files

The `dist` folder contains all the files needed for hosting:

```
dist/
├── index.html              # Main entry point
├── vite.svg               # Favicon
├── .htaccess              # Apache server routing config
├── _redirects             # Netlify routing config
└── assets/
    ├── index-jF87LMIC.js     # Minified JavaScript (313.63 kB → 97.35 kB gzipped)
    ├── index-DlAxpJ8o.css   # Minified CSS (78.61 kB → 13.97 kB gzipped)
    └── [images...]          # Optimized images and assets
```

## 🌐 Hosting Options

### Option 1: Netlify (Recommended)
1. Drag and drop the entire `dist` folder to [netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)
2. The `_redirects` file will handle client-side routing
3. Your site will be live immediately with HTTPS

### Option 2: Vercel
1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. In the `dist` folder, run: `vercel --prod`
3. Follow the prompts to deploy

### Option 3: Traditional Web Hosting (cPanel/Apache)
1. Upload all files from `dist` folder to your web root (usually `public_html`)
2. The `.htaccess` file will handle client-side routing
3. Ensure your hosting supports `.htaccess` files

### Option 4: Firebase Hosting
1. Install Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
2. Run `firebase init hosting` in your project root
3. Set public directory to `dist`
4. Configure as single-page app: Yes
5. Run `firebase deploy`

### Option 5: GitHub Pages
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to repository Settings → Pages
3. Select source: GitHub Actions
4. Use the pre-built "Deploy React App" workflow

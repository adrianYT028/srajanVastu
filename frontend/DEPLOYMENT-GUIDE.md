## 🌐 HostingRaja Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Access Your HostingRaja cPanel
1. Go to your HostingRaja dashboard
2. Click on **cPanel** or **File Manager**
3. Log in with your credentials

### Step 2: Backup Current Website (IMPORTANT!)
1. In File Manager, navigate to `public_html`
2. Select all files and create a backup:
   - Click **Compress** → Choose ZIP format
   - Name it `backup-before-update-oct-8-2025.zip`
   - Download this backup to your computer

### Step 3: Clear Old Files
1. In `public_html`, select all old files (EXCEPT the backup you just created)
2. Delete them to make room for fresh deployment
3. Keep any `.well-known` folder (SSL certificates)

### Step 4: Upload New Production Files
1. Open your local `frontend/dist/` folder
2. Select ALL files and folders:
   - `index.html`
   - `.htaccess` (very important for routing!)
   - `assets/` folder with all its contents
3. Upload to `public_html` using:
   - **Method A**: File Manager → Upload button
   - **Method B**: FTP client (FileZilla, WinSCP)

### Step 5: Verify File Permissions
In File Manager, check permissions:
- Files (including .htaccess): **644**
- Folders (assets, public_html): **755**
- Fix if needed: Right-click → Change Permissions

### Step 6: Test Your Website
Open your website and verify:
1. ✅ Homepage loads with new logo (03.png)
2. ✅ Hero shows "Energy. Wisdom. Harmony."
3. ✅ All three buttons work (Services, Products, Consultation)

## 🌐 Alternative Hosting Options (If Needed)

### Option 1: Netlify (Recommended)

### Option 3: Traditional Web Hosting (cPanel/Apache)
1. Upload all files from `dist` folder to your web root (usually `public_html`)
2. The `.htaccess` file will handle client-side routing
3. Ensure your hosting supports `.htaccess` files

### Option 4: Firebase Hosting
1. Install Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
2. Run `firebase init hosting` in your project root
3. Set public directory to `dist`
4. Configure as single-page app: Yes
5. Run `firebase deploy`

**Solution**:

- Check file paths are correct (case-sensitive on Linux servers)
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5)

### Issue: CSS/Styles Not Applying
**Solution**:
- Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check that `assets/index-s2Tt1Q6D.css` is uploaded
- Verify file permissions (644)

### Issue: WhatsApp Links Not Working
**Solution**:
- Phone number format should be: 919650786531 (no spaces, dashes, or +)

### Issue: Mixed Content Warning (HTTP/HTTPS)
**Solution**:

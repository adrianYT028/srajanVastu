# HOSTINGRAJA DEPLOYMENT GUIDE - SRAJAN VASTU

## ‚úÖ DIST FOLDER IS READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

Your `dist` folder now contains all the necessary files for deployment on HostingRaja with the 404 routing issue FIXED.

## üìÅ WHAT'S IN THE DIST FOLDER:
- ‚úÖ `index.html` - Main application file
- ‚úÖ `assets/` - All optimized CSS, JS, and image files
- ‚úÖ `.htaccess` - **FIXES 404 ROUTING ISSUE** for Apache servers
- ‚úÖ `web.config` - Backup for IIS servers
- ‚úÖ `_redirects` - For future Netlify migration
- ‚úÖ `vite.svg` - Favicon

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT STEPS FOR HOSTINGRAJA:

### Option 1: Upload via File Manager (Recommended)
1. Login to your HostingRaja cPanel
2. Open **File Manager**
3. Navigate to `public_html` or your domain folder
4. **DELETE all existing files** in the folder
5. **Upload ALL contents** from the `dist` folder
6. Extract if uploaded as ZIP

### Option 2: Upload via FTP
1. Use FileZilla or any FTP client
2. Connect to your HostingRaja FTP
3. Navigate to `public_html`
4. Upload all files from `dist` folder

## üîß FIXING THE 404 ROUTING ISSUE:

The `.htaccess` file in your dist folder contains these rules:
```apache
Options -MultiViews
RewriteEngine On

# Handle client-side routing for React SPA
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
```

**This tells the server:**
- If someone visits `/about`, `/services`, etc.
- And no physical file exists at that path
- Redirect them to `index.html`
- Let React Router handle the routing

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IF 404 ERRORS STILL OCCUR:

### Step 1: Check .htaccess Support
Contact HostingRaja support and ask:
- "Is mod_rewrite enabled for my account?"
- "Can I use .htaccess files?"

### Step 2: Alternative .htaccess (if the first one fails)
Replace the .htaccess content with:
```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.html?/$1 [L]
```

### Step 3: Last Resort - Hash Routing
If .htaccess doesn't work at all, I can modify your app to use hash routing:
- URLs become: `yoursite.com/#/about` instead of `yoursite.com/about`
- Works without server configuration

## ‚úÖ POST-DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST:
1. Visit your main domain - should load homepage
2. Try direct URLs:
   - `yoursite.com/about`
   - `yoursite.com/services`
   - `yoursite.com/contact`
3. All should work without 404 errors

## üìû HOSTINGRAJA SPECIFIC NOTES:
- HostingRaja uses Apache servers (usually)
- .htaccess should work by default
- If issues persist, their support is generally helpful
